\* shryr's Dotemacs

This is my Emacs configuration. As with every Emacs configuration, it
works very well for my needs, and there is always something to learn
from each configuration. In general, I use Emacs for task management,
coding, email, web browsing, blogging, as well as a journal system to
say the least. Using and learning Emacs and Org mode has changed my
life.

Package management via straight.el. I use an org-mode based literate
configuration, and my configuration is fluid as you can see from the
number of commits. I would recommend browsing through the configuration
and picking up the snippets that interest you. The file
[[file:emacs-config.org][emacs-config.org]] is the source of truth from
which every file is tangled.
